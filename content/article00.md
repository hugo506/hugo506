Summary:  Edmund's gold


Let me tell you about Edmund. 

Heâ€™s 57 and originally from...somewhere in Europe... Poland I think, but he represented Costa Rica in the Panamerican weight lifting 
senior competition and won!
Congrats Edmund!

He has won many other medals, and has represented other countries. He said his dream was to represent Costa Rica - he's retired and living here now.

I think he is a great example of not giving up and the importance of having goals and working towards them, regardless of age or circumstance.
